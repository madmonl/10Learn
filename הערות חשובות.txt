-- about mount shallow and render:
-when mounting also child nodes are fully rendered.
when state changes there is a need in wrapper.update
in order of fully rendering the component with respect of
the new state values.
-when mounting- one is not able to reach the state of the 
component since it is a HOC already and bla bla bla, so
mount(shallow.get(0)) should work, but then there is a problem
with something else that you will have to find out cause I can't 
recall- but when you will- solutions is to split tests :)
-if using Button.onClick mount is needed for full child rendering.
